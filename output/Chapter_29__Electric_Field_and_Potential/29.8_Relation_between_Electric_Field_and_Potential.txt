Okay, let's get you prepped for your exam on the relationship between electric field and potential.

**Key Concepts & Formulas**

*   **Potential Difference & Work:** The potential difference between two points is the work done per unit charge to move a charge between those points.
*   **Formula:** `dV = - E · dr`  This is super important! It connects the electric field (E) and the change in potential (dV) over a small displacement (dr).  The dot product means you only care about the component of the electric field *along* the displacement.
*   **Integration:**  `V₂ - V₁ = - ∫ E · dr`  This lets you find the potential difference between two points if you know the electric field along the path between them.  Agar electric field constant hai, toh yeh ban jaata hai `V = -E*d`
*   **Electric Field as a Gradient:**  `E = -∇V`  (or in components: `Ex = -∂V/∂x`, `Ey = -∂V/∂y`, `Ez = -∂V/∂z`).  This means the electric field points in the direction of the *steepest decrease* in potential. Electric field nikalne ke liye potential ko differentiate karna padega.

**Common Question Patterns & How to Approach Them**

1.  **Finding Potential from Electric Field:**
    *   **Problem:** You're given an electric field (maybe uniform, maybe not) and asked to find the potential difference between two points.
    *   **Approach:** Use `V₂ - V₁ = - ∫ E · dr`. Choose a convenient path between the points. If the electric field is constant, the integral becomes simple multiplication.
    *   **Example:** Figure (29.9) in the PDF.  Electric field uniform hai, toh seedha `V = E*d` use karo.

2.  **Finding Electric Field from Potential:**
    *   **Problem:** You're given a potential function V(x, y, z) and asked to find the electric field.
    *   **Approach:** Use `E = -∇V`. This means taking the (negative) partial derivatives of V with respect to x, y, and z to find the x, y, and z components of the electric field.
    *   **Example:**  Agar V = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 hai, toh Ex = -2x, Ey = -2y, Ez = -2z.

3.  **Equipotential Surfaces:**
    *   **Problem:** Questions about the relationship between equipotential surfaces and electric field lines.
    *   **Approach:** Remember that electric field lines are *always perpendicular* to equipotential surfaces.  Agar equipotential surface pata hai, toh electric field direction uske perpendicular hoga.

**Quick Revision Points (Last Minute!)**

*   `dV = - E · dr`: The fundamental link.
*   Electric field points from high to low potential.
*   Electric field is strongest where potential changes most rapidly.
*   Equipotential surfaces are perpendicular to electric field lines.
*   Uniform electric field means constant potential gradient.

**Real-World Applications**

*   **Electronics:** Understanding potential differences is crucial for designing circuits.  Voltages drive current.
*   **Capacitors:**  The potential difference across a capacitor is related to the charge stored.
*   **Medical Imaging (ECG, EEG):**  Measuring potential differences on the body's surface can reveal information about the heart and brain.
