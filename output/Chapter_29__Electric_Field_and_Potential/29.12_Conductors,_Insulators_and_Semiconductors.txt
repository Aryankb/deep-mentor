Okay, let's cram for this conductors, insulators, and semiconductors chapter! bilkul last-minute revision style mein.

**29.12 Conductors, Insulators aur Semiconductors**

*   **Key Concept:** Materials ko unke electric field mein react karne ke tareeke se categorize karna. Think of it like this: kuch materials electric current ko easily jaane dete hain, kuch bilkul nahi, aur kuch beech mein.

*   **Conductors:**
    *   **Explanation:** Inme bahut saare "free electrons" hote hain jo move kar sakte hain.
    *   **Real-world Application:** wires, metals used in electronics.
    *   **Quick Revision:** Free electrons = easy current flow. Metals are generally conductors.
    *   metals are conductors
*   **Insulators:**
    *   **Explanation:** Electrons tightly bound hote hain; move nahi kar sakte easily.
    *   **Real-world Application:** Plastic coating on wires, rubber.
    *   **Quick Revision:** No free electrons = no current flow. Non-metals like rubber are often insulators.
    *   nonmetals are insulators.
*   **Semiconductors:**
    *   **Explanation:** Conductors aur insulators ke beech mein. Their conductivity can be controlled.
    *   **Real-world Application:** Computer chips, transistors, solar cells.
    *   **Quick Revision:** Conductivity controlled by temperature/impurities. Silicon is a key semiconductor.
    *   behaviour is like an insulator at the temperature 0 K

**29.13 Electric Field Inside a Conductor**

*   **Key Concept:** Electrostatic equilibrium mein, conductor ke andar electric field zero hota hai. This is super important!

*   **Explanation:**
    *   Agar aap conductor ko electric field mein rakhte ho, to free electrons redistribute ho jaate hain surface pe.
    *   yeh redistribution conductor ke surface pe charges banata hai jo exactly applied electric field ko cancel karte hain.
    *   **Formula:** E (inside conductor) = 0 (in electrostatic conditions)

*   **Common Question Pattern:**
    *   "Explain why the electric field inside a conductor is zero in electrostatic equilibrium."
    *   **Approach:** electrons redistribute themselves and the induced charge cancels out the external field.

*   **Real-world Application:** Faraday cage, shielding sensitive electronics.

*   **Quick Revision Points:**
    *   Electric field zero inside conductor.
    *   Free electrons redistribute.
    *   Redistribution happens very quickly (milliseconds).
