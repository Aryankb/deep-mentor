Okay, let's cram for your exam on Electric Potential due to a Point Charge! ‚ö°Ô∏è

**Key Concepts & Formulas (Seedhe point pe aao!)**

*   **Electric Potential:** Potential difference matlab ek point se dusre point me charge ko le jaane me kitna work done karna pada per unit charge. Think of it like "electric height". Formula: `V = U/q` where `U` potential energy, `q` is charge.
*   **Potential Difference**: the difference in electric potential between two points. It is related to the work required to move a unit positive charge between those two points.
*   **Electric Potential due to a Point Charge:** Kisi ek point charge `Q` ki wajah se `r` distance door potential kitna hoga. Formula:

    `V = Q / (4œÄŒµ‚ÇÄr)`

    where `Œµ‚ÇÄ` (epsilon naught) is permittivity of free space (constant value).
*   **Superposition Principle:** Agar bahut saare charges hain, toh total potential kisi point pe har ek charge ke potential ka sum hoga. Just add them up (with signs!).
    `V = (1 / 4œÄŒµ‚ÇÄ) Œ£ (Qi / ri)`

**Common Question Patterns & Approach (Kaise solve karein?)**

1.  **Direct Formula Application:** Seedha values given honge, `Q` aur `r`, and you need to find `V`. Plug and chug! Make sure units are consistent (Coulombs for charge, meters for distance).
2.  **Multiple Charges:** You'll have multiple charges at different distances from a point. Calculate the potential due to each charge separately, then add them up (superposition). Pay close attention to the signs of the charges (+ or -).
3.  **Finding Work Done:** You might be asked to find the work done in moving a charge from one point to another.  Use the relation: `W = q(V‚ÇÇ - V‚ÇÅ)`.  `V‚ÇÇ - V‚ÇÅ` is the potential difference between the two points.
4.  **Potential Energy:** Potential energy `U = qV`.

**Real-World Applications (Kahan use hota hai?)**

*   **Electronics:** Understanding potential is crucial in designing circuits, capacitors, and other electronic components.
*   **Medical Devices:**  EKG and EEG machines use electric potential differences to monitor heart and brain activity.
*   **Lightning:** Huge potential differences build up between clouds and the ground, leading to lightning strikes.

**Quick Revision Points (Last-minute ke liye!)**

*   Potential is a SCALAR quantity. No direction! Just add with signs.
*   Potential is defined with respect to a reference point (usually infinity).
*   Electric field is related to the *change* in potential.

**Example type questions**

*   **Ek charge +5¬µC hai, usse 10 cm door potential nikalo.** (Direct formula)
*   **Do charges hain, +2¬µC and -3¬µC, ek dusre se 5 cm door. Unke beech mein potential nikalo.** (Superposition)
*   **Ek electron ko 200V potential difference se accelerate kiya. Uska kinetic energy nikalo.** (Work-energy theorem using potential difference)

All the best for your exam! üëç
